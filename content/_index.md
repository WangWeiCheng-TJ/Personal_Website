        I am a doctoral researcher specializing in developing transferable and privacy-friendly deep learning frameworks for complex, real-world audio and visual data. With hands-on experience tackling privacy, data scarcity, and cross-domain deployment challenges in smart urban environments, I am now seeking full-time opportunities in Europe (including the UK) and Canada to advance cutting-edge AI solutions with direct impact.

        Open to both research and applied scientist roles in the AI industry, particularly focused on computer vision and audio analytics.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate with the <a href="https://decide.ugent.be/">DECIDE</a> team at <a href="https://idlab.ugent.be/home">IDLab</a>, Ghent University-imec. My research is fully funded by the AI Flanders strategic program and is supervised by <a href="https://research.ugent.be/web/person/pieter-simoens-0/en">Prof Pieter Simoens</a> and <a href="https://research.ugent.be/web/person/sam-leroux-0/en">Prof Sam Leroux</a>.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        My doctoral work focuses on developing transferable and privacy-friendly deep learning techniques for real-world audio-visual urban surveillance: bridging the gap between the lab and dynamic street environments. The goal is to create frameworks that are both technically advanced and ethically robust, ensuring responsible AI deployment in smart cities. This has involved designing self-supervised and contrastive learning models for urban monitoring, collaborating with industry partners to validate results with domain-specific datasets, and innovating on privacy protection mechanisms that empower user consent.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        My research outcomes include peer-reviewed publications in journals such as IEEE Pervasive Computing, Sensors, and Frontiers in Robotics and AI. Many of these methodologies have been presented at academic and industry events and are now being adopted in practical applications: extending beyond the academic context to immediate societal impact.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Beyond research, I am passionate about mentorship and leadership. Iâ€™ve served as a teaching assistant for three semesters in "Applied Machine Learning," guiding students through real-world data-driven projects using tools ranging from Airbnb datasets to Sony Depthsensing. As President of the Taiwanese Student Association in Ghent, I initiated and led a city-wide mentor-mentee program that supported our community throughout the pandemic, further sharpening my cross-cultural collaboration and community-building skills.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Together, these experiences reflect my commitment to advancing AI technology that is not only powerful, but also human-centric, transparent, and positively impactful for diverse urban societies.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        I believe it is our collective responsibility as researches to not only build powerful tools, but to actively envision and advocate for their use in service of human dignity and safety. 
        Ultimately, my goal is to let deep learning prove valuable in addressing the practical needs of our most vulnerable populations in their most difficult moments.
