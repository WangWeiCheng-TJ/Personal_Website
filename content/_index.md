      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate with the DECIDE team at IDLab, Ghent University-imec, with my work fully funded by the AI Flanders strategic research program. My doctoral research on smart city surveillance aims to tackle the real-world deployment challenges of deep learning models for audio and video analysis. The goal is to create frameworks that are not only technically advanced but also ethically grounded and privacy-aware, making them practical for real-world deployment. The results and methodologies of this work have been published in peer-reviewed journals and conferences, including IEEE Pervasive Computing, Sensors, and Frontiers Robotics and AI.
        
        Beyond research, I have consistently developed my leadership and mentorship skills. As a teaching assistant for three semsters of "Applied Machine Learning" for both Bachelor's and Master's students, I developed my ability to communicate complex topics by guiding hands-on projects using real-world tools, from Airbnb datasets to Sony's depth cameras. Concurrently, as President of the Taiwanese Student Association in Ghent, I served as the community's main contact and initiated a mentor-mentee program to support students and residents during the pandemic, strengthening my skills in community building and cross-cultural coordination.
