Bridging the gap between academic models and real-world deployment.

My Ph.D. research tackles the critical bottlenecks that prevent deep learning models from moving "from lab to street": privacy risks, data scarcity, and environmental domain shifts. I proposed a unified framework for urban surveillance that balances performance with ethical compliance and robustness.

The dissertation is built upon three core technical pillars:
* Privacy-Friendly Visual Analysis: <br>
Addressing the trade-off between utility and privacy. I developed source-free and label-free obfuscation techniques that allow models to detect anomalies while stripping away sensitive biometric information, ensuring compliance with strict regulations like GDPR.

* Audio-Visual Representation Learning: <br>
Overcoming the reliance on expensive manual labels. I introduced contrastive learning frameworks that leverage the natural synchronization of sight and sound to learn robust feature representations in a self-supervised manner.

* Transferability Assessment: <br>
Ensuring reliability in changing environments. I designed metrics to assess model transferability across different camera views and domains without requiring access to source data, enabling safer and more predictable deployment in the wild.

(This research culminated in a Ph.D. degree from Ghent University and 5 publications in top-tier journals/conferences.)
