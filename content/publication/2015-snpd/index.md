abstract: "In this paper, we propose a new temporal coherent face descriptor for video gender recognition. The proposed face descriptor is constructed from detected faces of continuous video frames. Because it describes detected faces under variant changes in continuous video frames and provides a unified feature description, face normalization and alignment processes can be avoided during gender recognition. Based on the face descriptor, a support vector machine classifier is applied to identify the gender of the subject in the videos. As shown in the experiments, our method not only achieves better results compared to the state-of-the-art methods but also the real-time performance for video processing."
summary: "This paper introduces a new temporal coherent face descriptor for video gender recognition, which constructs a unified feature description from continuous video frames to eliminate the need for face normalization and alignment, achieving real-time, state-of-the-art results using a support vector machine classifier."
