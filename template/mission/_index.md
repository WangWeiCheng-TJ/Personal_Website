      title: 'My Philosophy'
      text: |-
        Scientific progress is the collective achievement of countless researchers, each passing the torch to the next. In that spirit, I believe my role is not to provide definitive solutions, but rather to build a solid foundation of practical and ethically grounded approaches for deploying intelligent systems in the complexity of real-world environments. My work focuses on contributing frameworks that emphasize adaptability, privacy, and contextual awareness, with the hope that they may serve as concrete tools for future innovation. 

        I believe the true impact of technology lies not only in what is built, but in what it may enable. I aim to contribute to the field not only by informing the design of intelligent systems, but by inspiring continued progress toward making technology truly serve its intended role: improving the safety, equity, and quality of human life. 

        Furthermore, I see a profound need to extend these technologies beyond urban convenience and into the domain of humanitarian aid. The same frameworks developed for analyzing complex scenes could be adapted to assist first responders in disaster relief scenarios, such as in the aftermath of a major earthquake, helping to categorize needs when resources are critically limited. They could also provide tools for humanitarian organizations to document events in other crisis zones in a secure and verifiable manner. 
        
        Ultimately, I believe it is our collective responsibility as technologists to not only build powerful tools, but to actively envision and advocate for their use in service of human dignity and safety. Meaning lies not in the possession of results, but in the integrity of participation. My ultimate goal is to see deep learning prove valuable in addressing the practical needs of our most vulnerable populations in their most difficult moments.
